      <description>Quickstart This article describes how to use the Mnist convolutional neural network to achieve digital recognition through the Sungem-SDK in the Android Studio development environment. The current example uses the camera that comes with the HornedSungem. If you need an external image source, please refer to SungemSDK-AndroidExamples.
step 1: Prepare the development environment  Download the latest versionSungemSDK-Android.jar package Prerequisites:  Make sure minSdkVersion is above Android 3.1 Make sure the Android device supports OTG Android Studio 2.</description>

      <description>This article mainly introduces how to use HornedSungem to load the SSD-Mobilenet convolutional neural network on the Android platform to realize face detection.
Preparation  For details on the configuration environment, please refer to quick start, I will not elaborate here. Download the model graph_face_SSD required for face detection, In your Android Studio, create a new assets package under the current module, copy the downloaded model file to this directory.</description>

      <description>This article introduces you to use HornedSungem to achieve hand-painted recognition under the Android platform.
Preparation  For details on the configuration environment, please refer to quick start, I will not elaborate here. Download the model graph_sg, In your Android Studio, create a new assets package under the current module, copy the downloaded model file to this directory. Because the project needs to process and display the image, the javacv library is use.</description>

      <description>This article mainly introduces how to implement a simple multi-model example using the multi-model version of HornedSungem under Android platform.
Preparation  For details on the configuration environment, please refer to quick start, I will not elaborate here. Download the models graph_face_SSD and graph_object_SSD required for detection, In your Android Studio, create a new assets package under the current module, copy the downloaded model file to this directory. Because the project needs to process and display the image, the javacv library is use.</description>
